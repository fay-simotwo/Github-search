## Project Description

The project is a web application that interacts with the GitHub API to provide user search functionality and display user information. Users can enter a GitHub username in the search input field, and upon submission, the application fetches data from the GitHub API to retrieve the user's avatar, username, and repository link. The retrieved information is then displayed in the result container.
